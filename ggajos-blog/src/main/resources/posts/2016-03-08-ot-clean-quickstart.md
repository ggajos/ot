The only prerequisite you need have already installed on your machine is JRE 1.8.
Now go to and unpack the [latest release of ot-clean](https://github.com/ggajos/ot-clean/releases)
and add it to your `PATH` so it will be visible and executable in the command line.
You might want to read also [How to efficiently manage PATH variable in Windows](http://ggajos.com/environment-variables-management/).
If you’re on other platforms you just need to add the executable to the path similar to Windows solution.
I’m planning to write down a small tutorial for Unix-like systems but feel free to submit PR
if you manage to run on your platform.

### Portable version
If you like, you can just put `ot-clean.jar` file in a directory where you are planning
to perform cleanup and just type `java -jar ot-clean.jar`. This will make your installation
purely portable and connected with your project.
